              <h2>About Earth</h2>
              <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and home to all known life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System,
                 only Earth sustains liquid surface water. Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, 
                 lakes, and rivers.The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed 
                 of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. </p>

              <h2>Structure of Earth</h2>
              <p>Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and crust.<br>

             The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius.<br>
             There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius.</p>
